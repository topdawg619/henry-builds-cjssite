# Henry Builds CJ's Site

This repo holds a mock landing page for CJ's mobile detailing business (Xact Auto Detailing). The goal is to provide a refreshed layout (hero, services, testimonials, booking form) that he can review before we wire it up to his live site.

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in a browser. Everything is static HTML/CSS/JS (no build step required).

## Structure

- `index.html` – markup for the landing page
- `css/styles.css` – site styles
- `js/main.js` – lightweight interactivity (sticky nav, smooth scroll)
- `assets/` – placeholder images/icons (add real photos later)

## Next steps

- Replace placeholder copy/images with CJ's actual content.
- Swap the static booking form for his preferred scheduling tool or embed the ZenBusiness form.
- Once approved, this can be pushed into the live hosting stack.
